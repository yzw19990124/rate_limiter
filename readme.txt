Quote from Alex Xu: "In a network system, a rate limiter is 
used to control the rate of traffic sent by a client or a service."
Three main pros of using a rate limiter for your API system:
1. Prevent resource starvation caused by DOS attack.
2. Reduce running server costs.
3. Prevent overloading the servers from excess requests.
